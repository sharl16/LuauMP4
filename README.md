# This is just source code so I don't get in trouble

A simple python script that slices .mp4 footage in .png files.

- Currently this works with PNG's, I am working on making this work with JPEG too because PNG's take too much space!
- The Plugin (Module comes with the plugin) is available at: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/18735535757, or you can just use it locally by extracting it from here
